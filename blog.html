       <h3 class="a">BIG DATA</h3>
       <p class="a1"> Graph Connectivity is the single most persistent characteristic of today’s networks environment.<br> 
           Networks with even a modest degree of complexity are not random, which means connections are neither evenly distributed nor static.<br>
            simple statistical analysis alone fails to sufficiently describe connected systems.<br>
             Therefore, most big data analytics today do not effectively model the connectedness of real-world systems <br>
             and have fallen short in extracting value from huge volumes of interrelated data.<br> 
             Therefore, with the increasing of large scale graphs, designing scalable systems for processing and analysing large scale graphs has become one of the timeliest problems facing the big data research community.<br>
              In general, distributed processing of big graphs is a challenging task due to their size and the inherent irregular structure of graph computations. In this paper,<br>
               we discuss how can the graphs connected in distributed environment to handling large chunks of the data.<br>

    <h3 class="aa">Education and the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
    <p class=a2>The COVID-19 pandemic is a huge challenge to education systems. This Viewpoint offers guidance to teachers,<br>
         institutional heads, and officials on addressing the crisis.<br>
          What preparations should institutions make in the short time available and how do they address students’ needs by level <br>
          and field of study? Reassuring students and parents is a vital element of institutional response.<br>
           In ramping up capacity to teach remotely, schools and colleges should take advantage of asynchronous learning,<br>
            which works best in digital formats. As well as the normal classroom subjects, <br>
            teaching should include varied assignments and work that puts COVID-19 in a global and historical context.<br>
             When constructing curricula, designing student assessment first helps teachers to focus. <br>
             Finally, this Viewpoint suggests flexible ways to repair the damage to students’ learning trajectories<br>
              once the pandemic is over and gives a list of resources.<br>
